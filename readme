### Introduction 

## This is my college project I did it using C#.net. The tool 

I created this small tool because I wanted to explore Dotnet. This tool is developed in visual studio using C#.
It allows you to do the following things with your system : 

• Change System Settings.
• Backup system settings.
• Reset Firewall.
• Kill system Process.
• View Operating system Information.
• View Processor Details Including Clocks and Load of processor in Real-time.
• Tweaks like Enable/Disable Taskmanager, Enable/Disable Balloon tips and adding a recycle bin in My computer, and more.
• View startup applications and disable them.
• Deleting Temporary Files with a single click.

Note that this tool is just for experiment purposes and is highly unstable. I personally do not take any risk if your system crashes or if you lose any of your data
